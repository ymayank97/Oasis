# Oasis Project 
<br>

### Overview
Welcome to the Oasis Project - a trailblazing decentralized social platform that's poised to redefine the digital landscape. Built on Moonbeam, this forward-thinking platform is fully compatible with Parachains, bringing to life a new era of interconnected digital communities.

The Oasis Project is designed to empower users by creating an inclusive, democratic space where everyone has a voice. Through the use of DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) structures, users have the ability to contribute, stake, and influence the direction of the platform, paving the way for a truly decentralized social network.

### Key Features
1. Smart Contract: The backbone of the Oasis Project is a robust smart contract, carefully constructed using Solidity 0.8.1. The contract handles staking, governance, and other key functions, allowing for seamless interactions within the platform.

2. Staking and Delegation: Through the use of ParachainStaking, users can stake and delegate, creating a system of incentives and rewards that fuel participation and engagement.

3. Access Control: The Oasis Project leverages OpenZeppelin's AccessControl to manage access and roles within the platform, ensuring a secure and fair environment.

4. Membership: A membership system, underpinned by a mapping structure, allows for the tracking of stakes and the management of membership fees, further enhancing the democratic nature of the platform.

### Tech Stack
1. Solidity 0.8.1: A contract-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts.

2. Moonbeam: An Ethereum-compatible blockchain platform on Polkadot that makes it easy to create multi-chain applications.

3. OpenZeppelin: A library for secure smart contract development.

4. ParachainStaking: For handling staking and delegation within the DAO.
